    <h1>Japanese illustrator - Yuko Shimizu</h1>
    <p>Yuko Shimizu (清水裕子) is a Japanese illustrator based in New York City whose work combines 
        Japanese heritage with contemporary reference points.</p>

        <h3>Early life and education</h3>
        <p>Shimizu was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>, and grew up primarily in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagawa_Prefecture">Kanagawa Prefecture</a>. 
            At the age of eleven, her father's company moved the family to the United States 
            where they settled in Westchester County, New York and would live there for four years 
            before returning to Japan. According to Shimizu, 
            attending middle school in the US encouraged a sense of individuality in her 
            that she would take back to Japan and that was not customary for women in the Japanese culture 
            of the time. Having a great appreciation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">Japanese comics</a>, 
            Shimizu imagined becoming a manga artist as a young girl. </p>
            <p>However, when it came time for university, her parents dissuaded her 
            from following an art education and she attended Waseda University in Tokyo with 
            a major in Faculty of Commerce. She graduated in 1988 as valedictorian.  
            Shimizu's first job was in the PR department of a large Japanese Corporation, 
            headquartered in Tokyo.</p>
            <h2>Illustration career</h2>
            <p>Shimizu began illustrating professionally in 2003 soon after she completed her master's degree.
                Her first client was The Village Voice, with art director Minh Uong. 
                She would soon add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker">The New Yorker</a> and the Financial Times 
                to her list of patrons.
                Between 2007 and 2010, Shimizu illustrated 33 CD insert covers for Now Hear This, 
                which was a recommended music listening list published by the UK magazine The World. 
                Covers in this series always depicted a woman and a music theme.</p>
               <p> In 2009, Shimizu was named among the 100 Japanese people the world respect by Newsweek Japan.
                Between 2009 and 2015 Shimizu created over 70 covers for the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comic</a> Series The Unwritten.
                In her first cover for the series, 
                Shimizu displayed many of the stylistic trademarks that would later brand her 
                as an innovator in the field of illustration by setting the mood of the big picture of the story.
                Her 43rd cover would win her a silver medal from the Society of Illustrators.
                Shimizu has illustrated for clients, such as Library of Congress, Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, MTV, 
                Target, National Public Radio, Time, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, GQ, and many more.
                In 2018, Shimizu would win 
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_King_Award">Hamilton King Award</a>, 
                considered by many to be the most prestigious award in illustration.
